# One user can enter a word and another user attempts to guess the word
# Guesses are limited, and the number of guesses available is related to the length of the word
# Repeated guesses do not count against the user
# The guessing player receives continual feedback on the current state of the word
# The user should get a congratulatory message if they win, and a taunting message if they lose

# First player enters word and word is stored in a variable
# Display the length of the word to the user in underscores
# Set correct_guesses to less than the length of the word
# Prompt the second player to guess a letter
# If the guess is correct increment correct_guesses by 1, and reveal the correct letter(s) in the appropriate underscore(s)
# If the guess is incorrect increment incorrect_guesses by 1, and inform the player they are incorrect
# Prompt the player to guess another letter
# If the incorrect_guesses is greater than the length of the word, tell the player they lost and exit the program
# Else let the player keep guessing letters
# If the player reveals the word, let them know they won the round
