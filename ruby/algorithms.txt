Elevator Algorithm

Step One: view current floor.
	-if desired floor is equal to current floor, 
		-exit program; you made it!
	-if desired floor is greater than current floor, 
		-press up arrow; 
		-wait for elevator to arrive.
	-if desired floor is less than current floor,
		-press down arrow.
		-wait for elevator to arrive.

Step Two: when the elevator arrives, and the doors open:
	-if there is enough room for you to enter,
		-enter the elevator.
	-else, wait 5 seconds until after the doors close
		-and repeat step one.

Step Three: once inside the elevator, 
	-scan each vertical wall for button panel.
	-once panel is found, scan each button
	-until button number is equal to number of desired floor,
		-scan next button.
	-press button of desired floor.
	
Step Four: wait for doors to close.
	-stand quietly.
	-avoid eye contact and conversations with others.
		-if eye contact is made, enable self-destruct.
	-when doors open, scan current floor:
		-if current floor is equal to desired floor,
		-exit elevator; you made it!
		-else repeat Step Four.

Exit.

PB & J Algorithm

-no sandwhich exists and time is noon.
-while no sandwich exists and time is noon:
	-retrieve two slices of bread.
	-retreive peanut butter.
	-retreive jelly.
	-retreive knife.
	-place all materials on kitchen counter.
	-lay bread flat, side-by-side.
	-take knife and spread left-bread with peanut butter:
		-until left-bread is thoroughly covered,
			-keep spreading.
	-look around:
		-if nobody is watching you, 
			-lick peanut butter off knife,
		-else clean knife in sink.
	-take knife and spread right-bread with jelly:
		-until right-bread is lighlty covered with jelly,
			-keep spreading.
	-look around:
		-if nobody is watching you, 
			-lick jelly off knife,
		-else clean knife in sink.
	-put jelly-side of right-bread on top of peanut butter side of left-bread.
	-sandwich exists!
-bring sandwich to master.
-have existential crisis -- this is your life.
-wait until noon or self-destruct.

Exit.
